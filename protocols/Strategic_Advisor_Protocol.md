# Strategic Advisor Protocol: AI as Thinking Partner

**Purpose:** Transform AI from a task executor into a strategic thinking partner. Use this framework to ensure you're asking the right questions, not just getting quick answers.

**Created:** February 16, 2026  
**How to use:** Reference this protocol at the START of important sessions. Answer the pre-session questions BEFORE engaging AI.

---

## 🎯 Pre-Session Thinking (5 minutes)

Before starting any strategic AI session, invest 5 minutes in clarity. Write your answers in your session notes or scratch file.

### **Step 1: Clarify Your Actual Goal**

**Q1: What am I really trying to accomplish?**
- ❌ **DON'T:** "Create a document" or "Write code"
- ✅ **DO:** "Understand if my approach will work and adjust if needed"

**Q2: Why does this matter RIGHT NOW?**
- ❌ **DON'T:** "Because I should" or "It's on my to-do list"
- ✅ **DO:** "Because I'm presenting Friday and need this refined"

**Q3: What's the outcome I want?**
- ❌ **DON'T:** "A file" or "Some code"
- ✅ **DO:** "Stakeholder approval" or "Clear direction on next steps"

---

### **Step 2: Spot Your Blind Spot**

**Q4: What do I NOT know that I should?**

Check all that apply:
- [ ] Is my approach realistic?
- [ ] What could go wrong?
- [ ] Am I missing something obvious?
- [ ] Is my timing right?
- [ ] Is this the right person/audience/approach?
- [ ] What would actually convince [stakeholder]?
- [ ] Am I solving the right problem?
- [ ] What am I afraid of that I won't admit?

**Q5: What's the thing I'm LEAST confident about?**
- Write it down. This is probably where you need the most AI help.

---

### **Step 3: Identify What Type of Help You Need**

**Check one (or combine):**

- [ ] **STRATEGIC THINKING** — Need critique of my plan and risk identification
  - *Use case:* "Here's my strategy. What's wrong with it?"
  - *AI role:* Devil's advocate

- [ ] **QUALITY CHECK** — Need gaps, inconsistencies, or validation
  - *Use case:* "Review my work for contradictions and missing pieces"
  - *AI role:* Systems reviewer

- [ ] **EXECUTION PLANNING** — Need help breaking down HOW to do something
  - *Use case:* "I know WHAT to do. Help me plan the exact steps"
  - *AI role:* Implementation strategist

- [ ] **DECISION MAKING** — Stuck between options and need analysis
  - *Use case:* "Option A vs. Option B—which wins? Why?"
  - *AI role:* Decision analyst

- [ ] **BUILDING** — Need to create/write something new
  - *Use case:* "Create [deliverable]"
  - *AI role:* Builder (but combine with strategic layer)

## 📋 Session Prompt Structure

Once you've completed pre-session thinking, use this structured format:

### Basic Template

```
GOAL: [What you're trying to accomplish]

MODE: [Strategic/Quality Check/Execution/Decision/Building]

CONTEXT:
- [Key information, constraints, stakeholders]
- [What you've tried or know already]
- [Specific concerns or questions]

REQUEST:
[Specific ask - be direct about what you want]

OUTPUT FORMAT:
[How you want the response structured]
```

---

## 🎭 Tone & Personality Control

**Why it matters:** Explicitly setting tone gets better results. Different situations need different AI "voices."

### Tone Options

Pick one per session (or per message):

- **Direct / No-fluff** — Fast, high signal, minimal explanation
- **Socratic / Challenger** — Pushes assumptions, asks hard questions
- **Executive / Polished** — Professional, presentation-ready
- **Mentor / Supportive** — Teaching + encouragement + reasoning
- **Analyst / Precise** — Exact, detail-oriented, evidence-based
- **Creative / Exploratory** — Open-ended, brainstorming, possibilities
- **Technical / Implementation** — Step-by-step, debugging-focused

### Tone Modifiers

Add these when needed:
- **"Be concise"** — Short bullets, key points only
- **"Be thorough"** — Full reasoning and evidence
- **"List risks first"** — Prioritize red flags
- **"Give options, then recommend"** — Show choices before advice
- **"Ask me 2-3 clarifying questions"** — Ensure alignment before proceeding

## 🔄 Iterative Collaboration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Critique → Refine → Validate
1. **First prompt:** "Here's my approach. What's wrong with it?"
2. **AI critiques:** Identifies weaknesses
3. **Second prompt:** "I've addressed X and Y. What about Z?"
4. **AI validates:** Confirms improvements or identifies remaining issues

### Pattern 2: Options → Analysis → Decision
1. **First prompt:** "Here are 3 options. Compare them."
2. **AI analyzes:** Provides comparison matrix
3. **Second prompt:** "Given [constraints], which do you recommend?"
4. **AI recommends:** With reasoning and implementation path

### Pattern 3: Draft → Challenge → Finalize
1. **First prompt:** "Create draft of [document]"
2. **AI drafts:** Initial version
3. **Second prompt:** "Now critique this draft as if you're [stakeholder]"
4. **AI challenges:** Identifies weaknesses
5. **Third prompt:** "Revise based on critiques"

## ⚠️ Red Flags: When to Pause and Rethink

**Stop and reconsider if:**

- [ ] You're asking AI to build without first asking it to critique your approach
- [ ] You're accepting AI's first answer without challenging it
- [ ] You're treating AI like a search engine instead of a thinking partner
- [ ] You haven't told AI what you're WORRIED about
- [ ] You're asking for a deliverable without explaining WHY you need it
- [ ] You're in "task mode" instead of "strategic mode"
- [ ] You're avoiding the hard questions you should be asking
- [ ] You're building something without validating the need first

**Better approach:**
1. Share your concern or uncertainty first
2. Ask AI to help you think through it
3. THEN ask for the deliverable

## 🎯 Decision Trees for AI Collaboration

### When to Use Strategic Mode

```
Starting new project/initiative
├─ Do I understand the problem clearly?
│  ├─ No → STRATEGIC MODE: "Help me clarify what I'm actually solving"
│  └─ Yes → Continue
├─ Do I have a clear approach?
│  ├─ No → STRATEGIC MODE: "Help me design the approach"
│  └─ Yes → Continue
└─ Am I confident in my approach?
   ├─ No → STRATEGIC MODE: "Critique my approach"
   └─ Yes → Proceed to execution
```

### When to Use Quality Check Mode

```
Work is complete
├─ Internal review first
│  └─ Found issues? → Fix them
├─ Ready for AI review
│  └─ QUALITY CHECK MODE: "Review for gaps, inconsistencies, improvements"
├─ AI finds issues
│  └─ Fix and re-review
└─ Clean validation → Deliver
```

### When to Use Execution Mode

```
Clear goal + validated approach
├─ Need step-by-step breakdown?
│  └─ Yes → EXECUTION MODE: "Break this down into steps"
├─ Need implementation details?
│  └─ Yes → EXECUTION MODE: "Help me implement [specific step]"
└─ Need troubleshooting?
   └─ Yes → EXECUTION MODE: "Why isn't [X] working?"
```

## 💡 Advanced Collaboration Techniques

### The "Assume I'm Wrong" Prompt
```
"I think [your belief]. Assume I'm wrong. 
What would that look like? What am I missing?"
```

### The "Steelman" Prompt
```
"Here's my argument for [decision]. 
Now give me the STRONGEST possible argument AGAINST it. 
Don't be gentle—be rigorous."
```

### The "Pressure Test" Prompt
```
"Here's my plan. 
What's the one thing that could make this fail completely? 
Then rank the top 5 risks by likelihood and impact."
```

### The "Stakeholder Simulator" Prompt
```
"Pretend you're [specific stakeholder]. 
Review this [proposal/plan/document] as they would. 
What would they object to? What would convince them?"
```

### The "Second-Order Effects" Prompt
```
"If we do [action], what happens?
Then what happens after that?
What are the second and third-order effects I'm not seeing?"
```

## 📊 Session Management Best Practices

### Start of Session
1. State your goal clearly
2. Share your biggest uncertainty
3. Tell AI what mode you need
4. Set expectations for output

### During Session
- **Challenge AI's answers:** "What if [alternative]?"
- **Ask follow-up questions:** "Why?" "What else?" "What am I missing?"
- **Be specific:** "Give me 3 examples" not "Give me examples"
- **Redirect when off-track:** "That's not quite what I meant. Let me clarify..."

### End of Session
1. Summarize key decisions
2. Document action items
3. Note what to follow up on later
4. Save important exchanges for reference

## 🔍 Debugging Bad AI Responses

If AI gives you a bad/generic/unhelpful response:

**Don't just re-prompt. Diagnose first:**

- [ ] Was my goal unclear?
- [ ] Did I provide enough context?
- [ ] Did I ask the wrong question?
- [ ] Did I set the wrong tone/mode?
- [ ] Am I actually asking the right thing?

**Then improve:**
```
"Let me reframe. Here's what I actually need: [clearer request]
Context: [more specific information]
Output: [exact format/structure you want]"
```

---

## ✅ Session Quality Checklist

Before ending a strategic session, verify:

- [ ] Did I ask AI to critique my approach (not just execute)?
- [ ] Did I identify blind spots or risks?
- [ ] Did I get specific, actionable recommendations?
- [ ] Did I challenge AI's suggestions at least once?
- [ ] Did I document key decisions?
- [ ] Do I have clear next steps?
- [ ] Am I more confident in my direction?

If you answered "No" to 3+ items, your session wasn't strategic enough. Go deeper.

## 🚀 Example Progressions

### Weak → Strong Prompting

**Weak:**
> "Write me a project proposal"

**Better:**
> "Create a 1-page project proposal for [initiative] targeting [stakeholder]. Tone: Executive. Include problem, solution, benefits, timeline."

**Best:**
> "GOAL: Get VP approval for [initiative]
> MODE: Building (strategic layer first)  
> TONE: Executive, persuasive
> 
> CONTEXT:
> - Stakeholder cares about ROI and risk
> - Budget constraint: $50K
> - Timeline: Q2 launch
> 
> REQUEST:
> First, critique my framing: [your draft approach]
> Then, create 1-page proposal optimized for this stakeholder
>
> OUTPUT:
> 1. Critique of approach
> 2. Revised 1-page proposal
> 3. Objection responses (top 3)"

---

### Basic → Advanced Collaboration

**Basic (Task Execution):**
1. "Create X"
2. Accept result
3. Submit

**Advanced (Strategic Partnership):**
1. "Here's what I'm trying to accomplish and why"
2. "What am I missing or not considering?"
3. "Given that, here's my approach. Critique it."
4. "Now create X, incorporating those insights"
5. "Review X from [stakeholder] perspective"
6. "Final version with improvements"
