## 🎯 Prompt Quality Standards

### Great Prompts Have 5 Elements:

**1. Context** - Situation and background
```
Good: "I'm a data analyst with 3 years experience working on customer retention"
Bad: "I need help"
```

**2. Task** - Specific thing to accomplish
```
Good: "Generate 5 strategic options for reducing churn from 8% to 5%"
Bad: "Tell me about churn"
```

**3. Format** - Structure of response
```
Good: "Provide table with: Option | Pros | Cons | Resource Needs | Timeline"
Bad: [No format specified]
```

**4. Constraints** - Boundaries and requirements
```
Good: "Focus on solutions implementable in <90 days with <$50K budget"
Bad: [No constraints]
```

**5. Validation** - How to verify correctness
```
Good: "Cross-check findings against industry benchmarks from Gartner report"
Bad: [No validation criteria]
```

### Prompt Evolution Process:

**Version 1 (Vague):**
"Help me with my project"

**Version 2 (Better):**
"I'm planning a customer churn reduction initiative. Generate some ideas."

**Version 3 (Good):**
"Generate 5 strategic options for reducing customer churn from 8% to 5% over next 6 months. Our constraints are: <$50K budget, team of 3, can't change pricing. Format as table with pros/cons."

**Version 4 (Excellent):**
"Generate 5 strategic options for reducing customer churn from 8% to 5%over next 6 months.

Context: SaaS product, $8M ARR, 10,200 customers. Recent analysis showed 68% of churned customers had unresolved support tickets.

Constraints:
- Budget: <$50K
- Team: 3 people (1 analyst, 2 customer success)
- Timeline: 6 months
- Can't change: Pricing, core product features

Output format:
| Option | Description | Pros | Cons | Resources | Timeline | Expected Impact |

Prioritize options by:
1. Speed to implement
2. Cost-effectiveness  
3. Likelihood of success

Validate against: Industry churn benchmarks (SaaS average 5-7%) and our root cause findings (support quality issues)."

## 🛠️ Advanced Techniques

### Prompt Chaining
Break complex tasks into sequence of focused prompts:
```
Prompt 1: Analyze → Get insights
Prompt 2: Using insights from above, generate options → Get options
Prompt 3: Using options from above, evaluate with criteria → Get decision
Prompt 4: Using decision from above, create implementation plan → Get plan
```

### Iterative Refinement
Don't expect perfect first try:
```
Round 1: "Explain X" → Get initial explanation
Round 2: "That helps, but can you give example of X in context Y?" → Get example
Round 3: "Now explain edge case Z" → Get deeper understanding
Round 4: "Summarize in 3 bullets" → Get distilled version
```

### Perspective Shifting
Ask AI to analyze from different viewpoints:
```
"Analyze this decision from perspective of:
1. Finance team (cost focus)
2. Engineering team (technical feasibility)
3. Customer (user experience)
4. CEO (strategic alignment)"
```

### Constraint Variation
Test robustness by relaxing constraints:
```
Base: "Generate options with budget <$50K"
Variant 1: "Now show what's possible with $100K"
Variant 2: "Now show what's possible with $25K"
Insight: Understand cost/benefit curve
```

### Meta-Prompting
Prompts about prompts:
```
"Review the prompt I just gave you. How could I make it more specific to get better results?"

"What information is missing from my prompt that would help you give a more accurate answer?"

"What assumptions are you making based on my prompt? Let's validate those."
```

## ✨ Final Thoughts

**This library is a toolkit, not a rulebook.**

The best prompt is the one that gets you the result you need. Start simple, iterate based on results, save what works, discard what doesn't.

AI collaboration is a skill that improves with practice. The more you use structured prompts, the more naturally they'll flow, and the more value you'll extract from AI tools.

**Your prompt library should evolve with your work.** This is a starting point—customize freely, share generously, improve continuously.
